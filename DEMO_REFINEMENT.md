## Behavior and evidence

At 5 simulated seconds the physical edge receives factor 3; known incidents and costs remain unchanged. Speed on that edge becomes one third of expected speed (approximately 35%). Telemetry computes speed from successive edge fractions and simulated timestamps. It rejects duplicate timestamps, invalid coordinates along an edge, and sparse intervals; normal-speed samples reset the consecutive count. Detection was visible at 84.5 s in the browser, real reoptimization started at 85.2 s, and replacement was applied at 85.9 s. There is no timer that directly triggers rerouting.

The browser showed no incident warning while ACTIVE_UNDETECTED, then the expected Vietnamese detection/update messages and a highlighted real directed road edge. All six vehicles completed deliveries and returned to the depot. The initial-plan toggle retained its original geometry after the dynamic solution. No browser console errors were recorded. An additional moving-fleet test verified working zoom while the real process job was pending and the simulation clock advanced from 23.3 to 23.9 s.

Three automated complete runs each observed 3 affected vehicles, 2 rerouted vehicles, and a 61.6-second reduction in remaining summed driving time compared with retaining the old routes under the same detected congestion. This is not a claim about real-world measured savings or full-fleet makespan.

Measured ranges on this machine: initial road-matrix/LNS/geometry pipeline 1.62-3.09 s; initial geometry 0.46-0.79 s; dynamic optimization 0.19-0.38 s. Browser route application including map/list redraw measured 95.8 ms. Times vary with machine load; optimization results are never precomputed or substituted.

## Implementation boundaries

- `road_network/costs.py`: cached timed road graph, snapped stops and explicit directed seconds matrices for initial LNS; meaningful shared-area analysis.
- `road_network/jobs.py`: one ProcessPoolExecutor worker with its own cached map; bounded job queue/history. Jobs return 202, and browser polling uses 300 ms intervals.
- `road_network/telemetry.py`: hidden physical event state and telemetry-driven lifecycle, separate from acknowledged IncidentStore costs.
- `server.py`: initial/dynamic job APIs, telemetry APIs, session/revision checks and applied-job acknowledgment.
- `road_network/routing.py`: snap cache; `road_network/reoptimization.py`: reuse static road preprocessing. Neither changes core LNS operators.
- `frontend/app.js`, `simulation.js`, `presentation.js`: hidden physical speed override, async job handling, live progress, separate initial/current solutions and route history rendering.
- `frontend/index.html`, `style.css`: same layout, updated labels, 680 px desktop map, smaller markers and specified palette.
- `data/presentation_scenario.json`, `data/scenario_validation.json`, `tools/design_root_scenario.py`: deterministic input design and validation. Route ownership/order is always generated by real LNS.
- `tests/test_presentation.cjs`, `test_dynamic_pipeline.cjs`, `test_telemetry.py`: full updated workflow, job polling and telemetry failure cases.
- `README.md`: current setup and API contract.

Shared areas contain at least 100 m of shared directed edges within 250 m, with centers at least 350 m apart. They are spatial corridor areas, not a claim that every grouped edge belongs to one continuous named street. Hotspot selection also verifies an alternative directed path and distance away from the depot.

Core SHA256 unchanged: `2504b679c60089bbf87d1f6d55717bd0d3804c90e104872d143aba5396134fed`. No destroy, repair, acceptance or stopping logic was edited. Original mathematical provenance tests pass. Raw OSM is unchanged. Both presentation initial and dynamic paths supply road-time matrices; the legacy `/api/optimize` remains compatible with Euclidean inputs when external matrices are omitted.

## Known prototype limits

Road speeds missing in OSM use an explicit 30 km/h estimate. Turn restrictions and truck dimensions are not enforced. Telemetry is generated by the accelerated browser simulation, not GPS. Sessions/jobs are in memory. Only one solve runs at once. Affected vehicles may wait at the end of their committed edge for a safe replacement; other vehicles continue. An optimization that exceeds the existing 10-second reserved progress horizon is rejected rather than applied unsafely. Keep the tab visible to avoid browser background animation throttling. Changes in map/runtime/seed require revalidating the fixed scenario.

Run `python server.py --port 8011`, open http://127.0.0.1:8011/ and click **Run Demo Scenario**. Allow about three minutes. Work stops here for review; no additional features were added.
